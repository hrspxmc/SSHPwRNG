# (PART\*) Evolutionary Computation I

# Introduction {-}

## Darwin meets CS
The question is *How much evolutionary science there is in evolutionary computation?* 
## Covered Methods

*Evolutionary computation* is by far most vast field of metaheuristic optimization.  

### **Genetic Algorithms** 

Most famous and popular branch of EvoComp. The root algorithm for many existing extensions. Best siuted for combinatorial problems.

### **Evolution Startegies** 

### **Genetic Programming** 

### **Differential Evolution**
